helpMessage = """**Welcome to the Support Squad fault bot!**
I'm still under development so please be patient with me.

I can help with the following things:

**!help** - gives you this chat. You knew this one already!

**!matches _<username> <n matches>_** - gives you the last n matches for the specified fault user. I don't know how many matches discord will allow me to send but I should be good for at least 2!

**!heroes _<username> <sort>_** - gives you the hero information for the specified user sorted.
You may sort by the following criteria:
- games
- kills
- deaths
- assists
- name

**!elo _<username>_** - Gets the specified player's MMR information.

More functionality is on the way!
