This is the FaultBot for discord created for lovers of Fault.

The bot pulls information from the PlayFault.com API to deliver match and player information with ease.

Present functionality:
 - Display the command list (!help)
 - Collect the most recent match information (!matches)
 - Collect the elo for the given player (!elo)
 - Collect the hero preference and performance information for a given player (!heroes)

To Do:

 - Change the messaging function to embeded messages for better readability and formatting.
 - Add functinality to FaultAPI.py to collect hero pick rates and win rates.
